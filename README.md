# PF_Electricity-Bill-Generator
The Electricity Bill Generator is a C++ console application that calculates and generates electricity bills for customers. It takes customer details (ID, name, address, date), calculates the total bill based on units consumed, adds fines for unpaid bills, applies a 5% tax, and displays the final bill both on the console and in a text file (bill.txt).
Key Features:
-Customer Data Input: Collects customer ID, name, address, and date.
-Bill Calculation: Calculates total bill based on units consumed.
-Unpaid Bills Check: Adds fines for unpaid months and displays a warning for overdue payments.
-Tax Calculation: Adds a 5% tax to the total bill.
-Bill Display: Outputs the bill on the console and stores it in a file.
The program provides a simple way to manage electricity bills, including handling unpaid amounts and generating detailed reports.
